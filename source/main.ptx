      <title>History of PASHoM</title>
      <p>
        Tom Bartlow described the genesis of PASHoM in  the summer of 2004 as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For many years friends interested in history of mathematics from
          colleges and universities in and around Philadelphia would greet one
          another at national meetings with the question, <q>Why do we have to
          travel hundreds of miles to talk about our common interest in history
          of mathematics? Why don't we get together at home?</q> In the fall of
          2000 David Zitarelli of Temple University and Paul Wolfson of West
          Chester University took the initiative, independently inviting people
          to colloquia at their institutions. At West Chester spoke on in
          November and in December at Temple Jim Stasheff talked about his
          experiences as a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950's.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two efforts prompted Tom Bartlow of Villanova University to
          invite all interested persons to an organizational meeting at
          Villanova University in January 2001. There it was agreed to establish
          the Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics to share
          our common interest in mathematics, to encourage one another in our
          research efforts, and to offer a forum for reporting on work in
          progress. Rudiger Thiele, who happed to be in town at the time,
          attended, offered us encouragement, and spoke informally about his
          investigation of Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem. He continues to
          claim status as the only foreign associate of PASHoM. Since then the
          seminar has met monthly, with interruptions in December and for
          summer. There are no officers or formal structure but David Zitarelli
          and Tom Bartlow have voluntarily assumed responsibility for necessary
          arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seminar will resume in the fall with a talk by Frederick
          W. Hartman of Villanova University on <q>Apollonius’ Ellipse and Evolute
          Revisited</q> on September 18, 2003 and a talk by Amy Ackerberg-Hastings
          on October 23, 2003.
        </p>
        <p>

          Meetings are at Villanova University, usually on the third Thursday of
          the month.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Tom Bartlow retired leadership in Summer 2012. Alan Gluchoff took over
        Fall 2012.

              <alert>Title: </alert> <pubtitle>The History of Markov Chains </pubtitle>
            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              This presentation will review the origins of Markov chains. Notably,
              Markov was inspired by poetry in his development of the chain link
              theory. His 1906 paper was the first to mention the idea of chains in
              which he stated that the that it was not necessary for “quantities” to
              be independent for the validity of the Law of Large Numbers. Markov’s
              interest in studying chain dependence stemmed from a dispute with Pavel
              Nekrasov from Moscow Mathematical School. Nekrasov, a deeply religious
              man, believed that the Weak Law of Large numbers was true for pairwise
              independent events only due to <q>free will.</q> Markov intended to refute
              Nekrasov’s statement and eventually proved that the Law of Large Numbers
              did not have to apply to independent events only. Why Markov chains or
              the chains of linked events are of interest now? The insight is that the
              current event depends only on the immediate previous event, not on the
              prior events and this process can be used in AI such as chatbots. Thus,
              100 years after the Markov Chains were introduced they are used in
              chatbots which prominently emerged in popular culture. Markov’s work has
              a great impact on today’s technology.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              A great deal has been written about map projections, and their
              development over the many centuries that human beings have engaged in
              map-making. From the time of Ptolemy, there have been various methods to
              carry out such projections, with the fundamental goal being the
              rendering of the globe or part of the globe onto a two-dimensional
              surface. Traditionally, history tells us that there were crude circular
              maps in the Middle Ages, and then a marked transition to Ptolemaic
              (mathematical) projections, followed by increasingly advanced
              projections, such as Mercator's. However, this lecture will present the
              conjecture that many of the circular maps from the late medieval and
              early Renaissance period were created using Albrecht Dürer's simple
              method of drawing a 3D object in 2D through the use of a device known as
              a perspectograph. This lecture will show how this method might have
              worked, and how it might have represented a way of creating 2D maps
              without formal projective geometry.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              The engineering drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are famous for both their
              ingenuity and aesthetic qualities. But Leonardo used drawing in a rather
              unique way as a method of “visual thinking” or formal analysis, to
              investigate and work out problems in fields ranging from anatomy to
              mechanics to hydraulics. Interestingly, Leonardo used this same method
              to investigate the possibility ― or impossibility ― of perpetual motion.
              In many of his notebook folio pages, we find pictures and text dealing
              with a range of designs for perpetual motion machines powered by weights
              or water. One can actually find a thorough typology in his renderings of
              various schemes for perpetual motion machines: a classification scheme
              based upon the various mechanical elements, and motive forces employed,
              that Leonardo posited or analyzed in these devices. This presentation
              shows that these are not random sketches, but rather a systematic and
              even mathematical <q>deconstruction</q> of the myth of perpetual motion.

              In this talk, we will look at the remarkable life of Edmond Halley (1656
              – 1742). Not just a predictor of comets, Halley produced the first star
              catalog of stars visible from the Southern Hemisphere. He also
              discovered an interesting root solving method, became the Savilian
              Professor of Geometry at Oxford after the death of Wallis, was a sea
              captain, and was named the second Astronomer Royal (succeeding John
              Flamsteed). Halley also played a major role in the Royal Society of
              London. It was a visit by Halley that encouraged Newton to write the
              Principia Mathematica and Halley used his own funds to publish the first
              edition. Halley also played a key role in the controversy surrounding
              the publication of Flamsteed’s star catalog (the controversy ended with
              a book burning!). Finally, we will discuss Halley’s election as the
              Clerk of the Royal Society which will help explain the title of this talk.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Dimension seems like an intuitive
              idea. We are all familiar with zero-dimensional points,
              one-dimensional curves, two-dimensional surfaces, and
              three-dimensional solids. Yet dimension is a slippery idea
              that took mathematicians many years to understand. We will
              discuss the history of dimension, which includes Cantor’s
              troubling discovery, the surprise of space-filling curves,
              the public’s infatuation with the fourth dimension, time as
              an extra dimension, the meaning of non-integer dimensions,
              and the unexpected properties of high-dimensional spaces.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              The Renaissance famously brought us amazingly realistic perspective art.
              Creating that art was the spark from which projective geometry caught
              fire and grew. This talk looks directly at projective geometry as a tool
              to illuminate the way we see the world around us, whether we look with
              our eyes, with our cameras, or with the computer (via our favorite
              animated movies). One of the surprising results of projective geometry
              is that it implies that every quadrangle (whether convex or not) is the
              perspective image of a square. We will describe implications of this
              result for computer vision, for photogrammetry, for applications of
              piecewise planar cones, and of course for perspective art and projective
              geometry.

              In this tak, we give a brief tour of the birth and early development of
              finite geometries, combinatorial designs, and normed algebras. Arthur
              Cayley (1845), Jakob Steiner (1853) and Gino Fano (1892) are credited
              with the creation of (respectively) the 8-dimensional real normed
              algebra, certain block designs with block size 3, and the first finite
              geometry. During our tour, we learn about the truly ground-breaking work
              of Julius Pl ̈ucker, John Graves (motivated by William Hamilton's
              quaternions), Wesley Woolhouse and Thomas Kirkman, work that anticipated
              Cayley, Steiner and Fano by one, 18, and 57 years, respectively.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              Our presentation will discuss the work and life of two Ukrainian
              mathematicians who lived in worked in the Soviet Ukraine - Mykhaylo
              Kravchuk and Nina Virchenko. The mathematician Mykhaylo Kravchuk was an
              important part of Ukrainian mathematics who dedicated his life to
              promoting Ukrainian culture and education. He was a member of the
              Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and in fact, his two-volume publication on
              differential equations was translated into English by the computer
              pioneer John Atanasoff who found Kravchuk’s results for his computer
              construction. Kravchuk was well-known in international circles, and
              perhaps it cost him his life as he met the fate of many members of
              intelligentsia. One must mention Nina Virchenko, a mathematics
              researcher and a follower of Kravchuk. She was also persecuted by
              Soviets, amazingly survived incarceration in a camp, and continued for
              decades to work on mathematics and to promote the achievements of
              Kravchuk. Naturally, the recognition of the Ukrainian mathematicians’
              achievements came with Ukrainian gaining independence in 1991.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              The civilization of the Maya, which began ca. 1200 BC, had a long
              history generally divided into three periods: The Pre-Classic period ca.
              1200BC - 200AD, the Classic period 200AD - 900AD, and the Post-Classic
              period 900AD - 519AD. The Maya civilization extended from what it is now
              Belize, Central and Southern Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and parts
              of Honduras. About thirty Mayan languages are still spoken in the
              above-mentioned regions, with a modern Maya population of about 5
              million. The Maya developed a glyph writing system, vigesimal and
              quasi-vigesimal number systems, and they mastered several areas of
              science, art, and architecture. Based on astronomical observations, the
              Maya created an elaborate system of calendars. In this talk, their
              number systems will be discussed, and algorithms for converting among
              the calendars that are simple enough to do with paper and pencil will be
              presented. This presentation will be available for incorporating
              ethnomathematics into mathematics courses and ethnomathematics focused
              courses.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
              Making sense of mid-twentieth century abstraction posed problems for
              both new and ongoing practitioners. To historicize aspects of processes
              of generalization and abstraction can be tricky as it is easy to be
              anachronistic. Hilbert's Grundlagen der Geometrie, for example,
              indicates the recognition of several possible positions on the nature of
              axioms, for example as <q>self-evident,</q> as idealizations of experience,
              or as rules. Since the axioms interact with definitions, this variation
              in ideas about axioms is accompanied by different ideas about
              definitions, ranging from definitions as descriptions to definitions as
              prescriptions. Description, though, is an equivocal term, since one can
              be describing an object one thinks of as existing, or as one that we are
              in a sense designing.

                Historical questions arise: in what ways, and in what terms, do
                researchers attempt to justify their particular approaches to
                abstraction and generalization? How do these justifications function? In
                the first half of the 20th c. they were not merely conventional in my
                view. In what follows, we discuss some research papers and look at
                explicit or implicit efforts to explain the value of the approach. Such
                justifications are so familiar now from textbook and other writing that
                they are easy to overlook.These various ways of justifying one's
                approach serve as a kind of guide to how the main models of innovation
                in twentieth century mathematics became standard. We look in particular
                at a set of examples around the <q>Lebesgue-Nikodym Decomposition</q>
                theorem in analysis.

              When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, America’s
              mathematicians had already been bracing themselves for war. This talk
              will examine the various venues in which they contributed to the war
              effort and indicate the sorts of contributions they made.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> In his autobiography, Mark Kac
              relates that as a teenager he became obsessed with the
              problem of deriving the Cardano formula for the roots of
              a cubic polynomial. He had been told that it was too
              hard for him. He succeeded, and it led to his becoming a
              mathematician. The derivation itself has been nearly
              impossible to locate, but it will be explained in this
              talk. Interestingly, it has some features in common with
              Lodovico Ferrari’s solution of the
              quartic. Additionally, some history of the cubic’s
              solution, some biographical details concerning Kac, and
              finally what may be the simplest derivation of the
              Cardano formula, due to François Viète, will be given in
              detail. This derivation seems easily within the reach of
              high school students. If time allows, Viète’s
              trigonometric solution to the casus irreducibilis (three
              real roots) will be sketched.

              Over its first 50 years, Bryn Mawr College boasted three remarkable
              mathematicians who, one after the other, left deep footprints on the
              institution and on the U.S. mathematical community. They were Professors
              Charlotte Angas Scott (British), Anna Pell Wheeler (American), and Emmy
              Noether (German). In this lecture, we meet these women and flesh out
              their biographies with plenty of local color … not to mention a
              real-life assassin in a supporting role. From 1885 to 1935, they gave
              Bryn Mawr a record of women in mathematics unsurpassed by any college,
              anywhere. [Zoom recording available upon request.]

The founding of the Weimar Republic in Germany at the end of World War
One opened the doors of mathematics academia for Jewish people. The rise
of the Nazi party in the 1930s closed those doors more tightly than ever
before. What happened in math departments in Germany under the Nazi
regime? How did the content, teaching, and research of mathematics
change? In this talk, we will first dissect the anatomy of mathematics
academia and identify key questions about the intersection of
mathematics and politics. Next, we will look the history of mathematics
under the Third Reich, with an emphasis on the way Nazi politics and
culture impacted the anatomy. This important period of history has
relevant lessons about how mathematics can be politicized today and in
the future.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The goal of our discussion is to present the portrait of Sophia
Yanovskaya, a mathematician and educator who made invaluable
contributions to the development of mathematical logic, history and
philosophy of mathematics, and research in the USSR. In 1933 Yanovskaya
and Vygodsky started the Seminar on History of Mathematics, and in 1943
Yanovskaya and Novikov organized the Seminar on Mathematical Logic and
Philosophy of Mathematics - the center of research in mathematical
logic. 1936 saw the first official course in Mathematical Logic taught
at Moscow State University by Sophia Yanovskaya. In 1959 Yanovkaya
oversaw the creation of the Division of Mathematical Logic at MSU in
1959. Dr. Yanovskaya’s publications included topics on history and
philosophy of mathematics, foundations of mathematics, mathematical
logic, and applications. There are many stories about Yanovskaya’s
dedication to her students and support of young mathematicians. The
biography of the Sophia Yanovskaya was complicated and currently many
regard her position to be not without a fault. One should remember that
the scientists of that era had little choice but to go along with the
political climate of the country.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In 1726, Alexis Clairaut presented four new families of curves to the
Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, at the age of twelve and a half. He
subsequently published an article featuring these curves in 1734.
Clairaut gives the algebraic and geometric properties of each curve, and
shows how they can be used to solve the ancient problem of finding any
number of mean proportionals between two given straight lines. He also
finds tangents to his curves, and computes their quadratures. In our
presentation, we will motivate Clairaut’s investigations and relate one
of his family of curves to those given by Descartes in La Géométrie.
We’ll also discuss our process of creating a critical edition of
Clairaut’s French text and translating the work into English.

Tarski’s are famous, but Pieri’s? I will trace back two themes in
axiomatics: selecting primitive concepts and formulating postulates
sufficient to develop a familiar informal theory; and deducing its
theorems as logical consequences. The modern concept of logical
consequence stems from Tarski (1953, 1935), then Ajdukiewicz (1921),
Pieri (1898), and Bolzano (1830s). I will sketch Tarski’s and Pieri’s
milieux in Warsaw and Turin, and survey Pieri’s pioneering development
of postulate systems. This presentation is extracted from three recent
books written with coauthors Elena Marchisotto and Francisco
Rodríguez-Consuegra and with Andrew and Joanna McFarland.

Stanislaw Lesniewski (1886--1939) received his Ph.D. at Lwow University
under the direction of Kazimierz Twardowski in 1912. After a few years
of teaching in schools for girls he left for Poland and soon joined the
codebreaking group that helped Poland win the battle of the Vistual. In
1919 he became Extraordinary Professor of the Foundations of Mathematics
at Warsaw University, a position created especially for him. His
obsession with the Russell Antinomy led him to create three foundational
system for mathematics: Protothetic, Ontology, and Mereology. His
concern for rigor led him to formulate the rules of procedure in a
precise way that was unmatched. We will discuss the basic ideas of his
systems and their fate.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
During the first half of the 19th century, the pendulum occupied an
important place in experimental physics and in surveying. Precision
pendulum measurements were used, for example, to determine accurate
values of the gravitational constant and to determine the exact shape of
the earth. The desire for exceedingly precise measurement meant that
temperature, humidity, altitude, external vibrations, and the medium
through which the pendulum swung had to be controlled or corrected for.
Simultaneous measurements being made at a variety of locations around
the world meant that assurance was needed that what was being compared
from one location to the other was actually comparable. Further, theory
was needed to support the various experimental results and to predict
the effect of changing conditions on the pendulum period. In particular,
the computation, from theory, of a vacuum to air correction factor for a
given pendulum was important. Sir George Gabriel Stokes provided this
theory in 1848 and he used divergent series to do so. This talk will use
a portion of the fascinating history of the pendulum during the early
19th century to establish their importance and then will take a close
look at the mathematics that Stokes developed in support of this effort.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The Polish mathematician Zygmunt Janiszewski made important mathematical
contributions during his life cut short by the 1918 influenza pandemic.
Janiszewski studied mathematics in Europe and after defending his
dissertation /Sur les Continus Irréductibles Entre Deux Points/ (1911)
under Lebesgue’s supervision, continued visiting mathematical centers in
Europe and attending conferences. Consequently, his meeting with the
Lwow mathematicians Józef Puzyna and Waclaw Sierpinski at the Congress
of Polish Scientists and Physicians in Krakow brought Janiszewski to
Lwow where he obtained his habilitation in 1913. WWI, however,
interrupted his plans of becoming a professor at the Lwow University and
Janiszewski joined the Polish Legion to fight in the war. During the war
years he came back to Lwow to substitute for Sierpinski, but was not
able to stay due to political reasons. Zygmunt Janiszewski went on to
become a professor at the University of Warsaw, even one of the
Mathematics Chairs. Janiszewski continued his research working alongside
with Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Waclaw Sierpinski. Zygmundt Janiszewski
published several important articles in pure mathematics and is
considered to be one the founders of the Polish Mathematics School.
Janiszewski was instrumental in setting the direction of Polish
mathematics at the time and establishing the journal “Fundamenta
Mathematicae” based on the novel idea of the journal devoted to a single
mathematical field. One cannot talk about Zygmunt Janiszewski without
adding that he was a Polish patriot and a humanitarian whose liberal
views were not easily shared by his colleagues.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Newton remarked to Halley that lunar theory gave him a headache. In
particular the calculation of the motion of the lunar apsides frustrated
Newton (an apse is an endpoint of the major axis of the ellipse defining
the orbit of a body). The lunar apsides rotate approximately 3 degrees
per month, but Newton’s calculations only showed half of this amount,
leading Newton to say that the problem was “too complicated and
cluttered with approximations.” In this talk we will examine Newton’s
lunar theory, his failures and successes, and his occasional use of a
fudge factor to get the theory to align with observation. Newton’s
biographer, Richard Westfall, once commented that “no one can manipulate
the fudge factor as the master mathematician himself.”

The overall theme of my talk is circularity. It pivots around research I
conducted with an archaeologist to find the center of an ancient
circular Olympic starting line. I'll begin with some history of the
ancient and modern Olympics (hopefully next in Tokyo in 2021) and finish
with examples of the importance of measuring the precision of circles in
engineering (pistons, shafts, bearings, etc.) and in astronomy (event
horizons of black holes, planetary orbits, Ptolemaic epicycles).

In addition to publishing postulate-theoretic results directed at his
research-oriented contemporaries, Harvard mathematician Edward V.
Huntington (1874-1952) wrote a number of pedagogical and expository
works in which he outlined the principles and aims of postulate theory,
and pointed to certain roles it might serve in mathematics and well
beyond. In this talk we explore some of these roles, focusing on his
arguments for the pedagogical and practical value of postulate theory,
and the reasons for which he sought to present this material to
non-research and even non-mathematical publics in the first place.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In the early twentieth century, researchers in the United States engaged
with foundational studies in mathematics by building and evaluating
axiom, otherwise known as postulate, systems. At the same time, their
contemporaries were evaluating the meaning and politics of knowledge
more broadly. In this talk, I explore the ways in which the study of
postulates in the United States was tied to important Progressive Era
questions about the nature of knowledge, the status of the knower, and
the development of American Pragmatism. While most investigations of
postulate studies have considered their implications within mathematical
research and education, I look instead to the role of postulate studies
in the professionalization of mathematics in the United States and to
its cultural status more broadly.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
It is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle, to double the cube, and
to construct every regular polygon with a compass and straightedge. But
Archimedes showed that if a straightedge is marked so it is able to make
one measurement, then, by using a technique called a neusis
construction, it is possible to trisect any angle. It is also possible
to double the cube and to construct additional regular polygons. In this
talk, we look at the history of the neusis construction from Archimedes
to the present day, and we discuss what additional geometric
constructions are possible using these tools.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The Lvov School of Mathematics officially existed from 1919 to 1939,
when the city of Lvov was part of Poland. The end of the school came
with the 1939 annexation of Lvov to the USSR and the German occupation
during WWII. We will discuss the works of the Polish mathematicians and
the establishment of the Lvov School as a natural outcome of the
development of mathematics prior to 1918, when Poland finally regained
independence. It is often called the school of functional analysis. We
will discuss the contributions of mathematicians who worked with Stefan
Banach, Stanislaw Ulam, Marc Kac, Stanislaw Mazur, Hugo Steinhaus,
Kazimierz Kuratowski. Sadly, many mathematicians from Lvov did not
survive WWII. Research was conducted at the University, which was
founded in 1661 and was affiliated with different countries over its
long history. Lvov Polytechnic was also a place for mathematical studies
Lvov School of Mathematics left invaluable legacy, and contributions
various mathematicians are numerous.

World War I had marked a break in business as usual within the American
mathematical research community. In its aftermath, there was a strong
sense of entering into “a new era in the development of our science.”
And then the stock market crashed. Would it be possible in such newly
straitened times to sustain into the 1930s the momentum that American
mathematicians had managed to build in the 1920s? This talk will explore
the contours of an answer to that question.

the program established regional administrators to oversee the

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The unique cultural traditions we associate with Japan flourished over
the century and a half during which Japan’s borders were closed to
foreign influence during the Edo period (1603-1867). Among the many
practices that were refined during this period, Japanese abstract
mathematics is not one of the most familiar. In this talk I give a
glimpse of some powerful techniques and problem-solving conventions
unique to Japanese mathematics, with a focus on how the ways they were
shared were in keeping with ancient Japanese culture. In particular, I
summarize the marvelous work done to date on historicizing the practice
of sharing geometrical problems via wooden prayer boards — “sangaku” —
displayed to the public at shrines and temples. In our discussion I
bring to bear my own work on public problem-solving exchange in early
18th-c. Europe and introduce questions about the roles of economics,
social expectations, gender, and faith in the mathematical exchanges of
each cultural tradition. I offer this talk shortly after having been
privileged to spend the first six months of 2019 in Kyoto, Japan, whose
thousands of active shrines and temples allow a wonderful ancient wisdom
to permeate postmodern urban society. If any would like to explore this
elegant and challenging geometry ahead of time, attached are
reproductions of two of the more accessible problems.

the purview of mathematicians thereafter.In this talk, we provide the
details of what Marian Rejewski and his colleagues did to crack the Enigma.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
During the 1960's Soviet government initiated major education reform in
USSR. Professor of Mathematics at the Moscow State University Andrei
Kolmogorov got appointed as the head of the mathematics committee of the
Scientific Methodological Council and got heavily involved in
restructuring the current mathematics curriculum.He aimed to merge the
rigorous and non-rigorous ways of mathematical thinking in the minds of
the students.Kolmogorov introduced a collection of pedagogical
innovations and emphasized the set theory, deductive logical approach,
and pre-calculus in the new curriculum. These changes in the curriculum
were influenced by trends in modern mathematical research, such as the
emphasis on rigorous and deductive logical approach, as well as, social
and ideological tendencies that prevailed in the Soviet society, such as
the rise of the Socialist Competition.Soon, however, the community of
mathematics educators discovered various shortcomings in the new
curriculum, and the decision to conduct counter-reforms were made.We
will discuss the intellectual, political and ideological factors that
shaped the development of the new Soviet mathematics curriculum, analyze
the legacy of the reforms, and explore the reasons for the decline of
the reforms.

Ada Lovelace is widely regarded as an early pioneer of computer science,
due to an 1843 paper about Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, which,
had it been built, would have been a general-purpose computer.Her paper
contains an account of the principles of the machine, along with a table
often described as 'the first computer program'. However, over the
years, there has been considerable disagreement among scholars as to her
mathematical proficiency, with opinions ranging from 'genius' to
'charlatan'. This talk presents an analysis of Lovelace's extant
mathematical writings and will attempt to convey a more nuanced
assessment of her mathematical abilities than has hitherto been the case.

Sometimes innocent questions from students can stir long-forgotten
memories and stimulate mathematical investigation.Last year I took over
my wife's Discrete Mathematics course for a week.I spent much of the
first class working out elementary induction proofs and introducing
recurrence relations.At the end of the class, one of the students asked
if there was a recurrence relation for the nth term of the Fibonacci
sequence.I was in a hurry to teach a class 45 minutes away, so I
foolishly replied that I did not think there was.On the drive to my
other job, I recalled Binet's formula which prompted me to dig up notes
on this subject that I had long since forgotten.This paper will discuss
my discovery and re-discovery of the beautiful interplay between Binet's
recurrence relation, the Golden Mean, and the Fibonnacci Sequence, as
well as, discuss whether Binet was the first to discover the formula.

The new math changed the way Americans think about mathematics. The
mathematicians and teachers who designed the new math—a novel curriculum
lavishly supported by the National Science Foundation in the 1950s and
1960s—believed they were doing more than improving computational ability
or producing more mathematicians. The new math embodied a plan to reform
American society by revolutionizing the way schoolchildren learned to
think. Forged in the crucible of Cold War fears of intellectual
inadequacy, deployed in the heyday of the liberal Great Society, and
criticized by ascendant conservatives in the 1970s, the new math was
fundamentally political. Debates about the math curriculum were debates
about how to shape American citizens.

Bolesław Sobociński (1906–1980) received his Ph.D. in 1938 under the
direction of Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1960) and then served as assistant to
Stanisław Leśniewski (1886–1939). This close contact with the two
founders of the Warsaw School of Logic determined the course of his
research. He played an important role in the Polish underground during
WW II, escaped to Brussels where he worked for several years and then
emigrated to the US. After a few years in St. Paul, MN, he joined the
faculty at the University of Notre Dame. He founded the Notre Dame
Journal of Formal Logic and edited it for 19 years. We will discuss his
interesting life and make some remarks about his contributions to logic.

Hill’s book features both familiar and unfamiliar, and will gain insight
into the state of the field at the time. Hill is comfortable with
well-defined algorithms and symbol manipulation, but he flubs a proof
involving the fundamental properties of prime numbers, and he treats
imaginary numbers with trepidation. Hill, an ardent southern loyalist
who would later serve as a general in the Confederate army, also spices
his book with anti-Yankee sentiments and unapologetic references to
slavery. This talk will touch on both the mathematical and ideological
aspects of Hill’s book, comparing it with some similar books of roughly
the same time period.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
 In this talk, we consider five texts written by the Harvard
mathematician Edward V. Huntington (1874-1952) and attempt to pin down
particular mathematical values informing and exemplified within his
work. In these texts, published in the first years of the 20th century,
Huntington presents a number of different sets of postulates defining
the algebra of real quantities and the underlying linear continuum. As
we will see, these postulate sets, which initially demonstrate striking
parsimony, ultimately reveal a pedagogically-informed classical,
analytical perspective, expressed in the logical formulation
characteristic of the the modernist transformation of mathematics that
took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Peter the Great established the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in
1724, and after its first meeting in August of 1725 the Academy quickly
became the center of scientific research in Russia. Mathematics
education at the University and Gymnasium part of the Academy became
vital for preparing research mathematicians and mathematics teachers. Of
course, the name of the Academy immediately brings to mind Leonhard
Euler; we however will focus on the other mathematicians who made
important contributions to mathematics. Our discussion will also include
the original papers from the Academy Archives on Vasievskij Ostrov.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> The term <q>Playfair's Axiom</q> is
              a mainstay of school geometry textbooks as well as one
              of the few things many mathematicians know about John
              Playfair (1748–1819), Professor of Mathematics and then
              of Natural Philosophy at the University of
              Edinburgh. However, the ubiquity of the phrase masks
              considerable historical complexity. At least three
              different versions of the statement circulate among
              speakers of English—only two of which appeared in the
              editions of Playfair's Elements of Geometry—while the
              underlying concept dates back to Proclus.  Additionally,
              the versions are not logically equivalent with each
              other.  I will discuss recent research that has revealed
              new information about when and why <q>Playfair's Axiom</q>
              became commonplace as a label.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In recent history and philosophy of mathematics, <q>structuralism</q> has
become an important theme. There are two different ways in which this
theme is typically approached: (a) by focusing on a structuralist
methodology for mathematics (concerning the tools used, the ways in
which various parts of mathematics are organized, etc.); (b) in terms of
a structuralist semantics for mathematics (a conception, or several
related conceptions, of what we talk about when we study <q>the natural
numbers,</q> <q>the real numbers,</q> <q>the cyclic group with five elements,</q>
etc.). In this talk, I will show that Richard Dedekind’s writings from
the nineteenth century should be seen as one of the main historical
sources for both strands. Moreover, the two strands are intimately
connected for him, as I will also try to establish. This will involve
comparing his foundational work (on the natural and real numbers) with
his contributions to algebra and number theory (his investigation of the
notions of algebraic number, group, field, ring, lattice, etc.,
including his famous theory of ideals). Dedekind built on the work of
his teachers and mentors, to be sure, especially Gauss, Dirichlet, and
Riemann. But he went significantly beyond them precisely by initiating a
structuralist transformation of modern mathematics, one that was later
continued by Hilbert, Noether, Bourbaki, and in category theory. Some of
the contents of this talk appeared in Professor Reck’s article
“Dedekind’s Contributions to the Foundations of Mathematics” in the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
How's that for the shortest title ever? How can you decide if a number
is the sum of two squares? Euler begins with the dumbest possible
algorithm you can think of: Take the number, subtract a square, and
check if the remainder is a square. If not, repeat, repeat, repeat. But
Euler, being Euler, finds a way of converting all those subtractions
into additions. He applies this to 1,000,009, and---in less than a
page---finds that there are two ways to express this as a sum of
squares. Hence, by earlier work in E228, it is not a prime. Amusingly,
when he later described how to prepare a table of primes <foreign>ad millionem
et ultra</foreign> (E467), he includes this number as prime. So he then feels
obliged to write another paper, E699, using another refinement of his
method, to show that 1,000,009 is not prime.

During the Enlightenment, the university was not the primary center of
intellectual activity. Instead, the major institutions for mathematics
and natural philosophy were the Academies of Science. The Paris, Berlin,
St. Petersburg Academies of Science and the Royal Society of London
sponsored research, gave academy members opportunities to present their
research in oral and written form, and encouraged communication among
the prominent scholars during the Enlightenment. The duty of the
scientific academies was to drive out superstition and ignorance by
establishing secure knowledge, of which mathematics is the most perfect
model. Mathematicians played central roles, both intellectual and
political, in these Academies.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Over a century ago Ernst Mach,
              the famous Austrian physicist and philosopher of
              science, wrote a blistering criticism of Archimedes'
              celebrated proof of the Law of the Lever. Mach accused
              Archimedes of overusing his <q>Grecian mania for
              demonstration</q> and succeeding in his proof only <q>by
              the help of the very proposition he sought to prove.</q>
              His attack drew the expected objections from many
              historians and philosophers of science who, in turn,
              accused Mach of not understanding the subtleties of
              Archimedes' proof. I will give my own interpretation of
              this controversy from a mathematician’s point of view,
              concluding with my belief that, while Archimedes did
              indeed prove something, it can hardly be called a proof
              of the Law of the Lever.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In 1646 the 17-year-old Christiaan Huygens proved that the hanging chain
did not take the shape of a parabola, as was commonly thought at the
time. Forty-four years later, no one had yet described the actual shape
of the chain, so Jakob Bernoulli posed the problem publicly in 1690.
Huygens then studied several aspects of this curve, which he called the
catenary, and published them in a short article one year later. We will
quickly review the earlier work of Huygens and concentrate on the work
from his notebooks in 1691. This talk is a continuation of the story
begun at PASHoM in April 2009, although attendance at that talk is not a
prerequisite for this one.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The only extant copy of "The Method of Mechanical Theorems" in the
original Greek has been known to exist in Codex C since Johan Ludvig
Heiberg (1854-1928) examined it at the turn of the 20th Century. Heiberg
succeeded in deciphering most of its contents using light, a magnifying
glass and a camera. Proposition 14, determining the planar cut of a
cylinder encased in a cube, a <q>hoof,</q> had a large gap hidden from
Heiberg in the gutter of Codex C. Heiberg wrote in Latin that <q>I shall
not speculate as to what could have been written in such a large gap.</q>
This gap was exposed by unbinding and modern imaging during the recovery
of the Archimedes palimpset after its sale to a private buyer in 1998.
Dr. Reviel Netz, a Classics scholar at Stanford who is fluent in the
Doric dialect of Archimedes and who was at the time completing an
extensive translation and commentary of Archimedes mathematics was
called in to consult after the codex was unbound. Dr. Netz subsequently
claimed that information hidden in the gutter of Codex C suggests that
Archimedes had considered a 19th century concept of infinity (actual,
completed infinity) in Proposition 14 of The Method. We will use this as
motivation for examining The Method through Proposition 1 in which
Archimedes shows Eratosthenes his heuristic method of realizing that the
area of a circumscribing parabola is 4/3 that of the triangle it
encloses and move to Proposition 14, show the rudiments of The Method
applied again and the Doric Greek hidden in the gutter that led Netz to
make his claim.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Guillaume François Antoine, the Marquis de l’Hôpital, wrote the first
differential calculus textbook, which he published in 1696. Leibniz’
calculus, which the Marquis had learned from Johann Bernoulli, was at
this time a calculus of algebraic functions only. Nevertheless, by
combining the techniques of the new calculus with methods of Euclidean
geometry, Leibniz and the Bernoullis were able to investigate the
properties of wide a variety of transcendental curves, including the
cycloid, the quadratrix, and various spirals. Through his groundbreaking
textbook, the Marquis de l’Hôpital shared these new methods with the
French mathematical community. In this talk, I will describe l’Hôpital’s
calculus, providing a variety of examples drawn from my forthcoming
translation of Analyse des infiniment petits, a joint project with Sal
Petrilli and Ed Sandifer.

The Archimedes Palimpsest, a 10th century manuscript, is the unique
source for two of Archimedes treatises, The Method and Stomachion, and
it is the unique source for the Greek text of ON Floating Bodies. All
these texts were erased in the thirteenth century, and written over. In
private hands throughout much of the 20th century, the manuscript was
sold at auction to a private collector in 1998, and subsequently
deposited at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland by the owner
a few months later. Since that date the manuscript has been the subject
of conservation, imaging, and scholarship. Entirely new texts from the
ancient world have been discovered, and transcribed, using many
different imaging techniques, including X ray flourescence imaging at
SLAC. This lecture will describe the history of the Palimpsest, its
imaging, and the recent discoveries.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The advent of modern digital computing in the mid-twentieth century
precipitated many transformations in the practices of mathematical
knowledge production. However, early computing practitioners throughout
the United States subscribed to complicated and conflicting visions of
just how much the computer could contribute to mathematics - each
suggesting a different division of mathematical labor between humans and
computers and a hierarchization of the tasks involved. Some imagined
computers as mere plodding <q>slaves</q> who would take over tedious and
mechanical elements of mathemtical research. Others imagined them more
generously as <q>mentors</q> or <q>collaborators</q> that could offer novel
insight and direction to human mathematicians. Still others believed
that computers would eventually become autonomous agents of mathematical
reasearch. And computing communities did not simply narrativize the
potential of the computer differently; they also built those different
visions right in to computer programs that enabled new ways of doing
mathematics with computers. With a focus on communities based in the
United States in the second half of the twentieth century, this talk
will explore different visions of the computer as a mathematical agent,
the software that was crafted to animate those imaginings, and the
communities and practices of mathematical knowledge-making that emerged
in tandem.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Some of you may be familiar
              with my work on the <pubtitle>Ladies' Diary</pubtitle>,
              an 18th- and 19th-c. British annual periodical that
              contained advanced mathematical problems (see
              esp. Osiris, 2002). Most of the research contained in my
              PhD dissertation (Cornell Univ., 2000) has remained
              unpublished. In this talk I will outline the historical
              perspectives that informed my approach to this material
              and report on my present experience of newly revising it
              for publication nearly 15 years on. From Anne’s reign to
              Victoria’s, the Ladies’ Diary or Woman’s Almanack hosted
              an annual mathematical exchange among an enthusiastic
              readership of men and women. In the dissertation I
              analyze the social structures that shaped the Diary’s
              first fifty years, including a feverishly consumerist
              print culture, genteel expectations of femininity, and
              the mathematization of early industrial technology.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Recreational problems have been a fixture in mathematics problem solving
from antiquity. it has long been known that the same problems reappear
in cultures all over the world - from ancient Egypt and Babylonia
through Greece, medieval China and India, and on into medieval Europe
and the Renaissance, as well as into modern times. What is surprising,
perhaps, is that often the exact same problems reappear, even with the
same numerical values, in cultures separated by many years and many
miles. We frequently have no idea of the paths these problems took in
moving from civilization to civilization. In this talk, we will look at
some appearances of two of these classic recreational problem types and
see how different people at different times solved them. Perhaps we can
also gain some insight into the methods of travel of these problems.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
This talk explores the history of the handheld electronic calculator in
American culture, as suggested by an ongoing examination of surviving
examples in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution. During the
first half of the 1970s, with the advent of inexpensive microprocessors,
the electronic calculator became a commonplace. Arithmetic, which had
been regarded by nineteenth century mathematicians such as Frederick P.
Barnard of Columbia University as <q>toil of pure intelligence,</q> could be
performed routinely by instruments that cost only a few dollars. In the
1980s, with the advent of programming graphing caluclators, the new
technology attracted the attention of college and university mathematics
teachers, and inspired discussions of curriculum reform.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Mary Fairfax Somerville's
              writings on mathematics and science made her a household
              name in Victorian England. Her most well-known work was
              Mechanism of the Heavens (1831), a highly valued
              exposition of Laplace.  While most of her titles were
              popular expositions, her book on Physical Geography was
              used as a standard textbook until the 20th century. Her
              publisher treated her with great deference and her
              influential writings led her to receive an annual
              pension from the British government from 1835 until her
              death in 1872. Yet Mary Somerville could not get her
              favorite project, a mathematical textbook on the
              calculus of variations, published. Why??? In answering
              this question, I will explore the concept of originality
              in mathematics (and in publishing), and how class and
              gender might have played a role. The talk will summarize
              my research on the manuscript and the correspondence
              between her and her publisher, and how I was led to this
              topic as part of researching a project currently under
              contract with Johns Hopkins University Press: The
              Material of Intellect: A Historical Sourcebook on Women
              and Mathematics, 1500-1900.

There are many interesting things in the cyphering books that George
Washington compiled as a teenager: His study of decimal arithmetic is
straightforward, but understanding some of the errors he made can be
fun. He had a technique for partitioning a plot of land into two equal
pieces, bit it was wrong---and so was his source. Some things are hard
to understand for time has passed them by. For example, his pre-Eulerian
trigonometry is a mystery today, so we shall elucidate it. We shall
present some pages of the cyphering books that the Library of Congress
did not digitize because they were at Cornell, Dartmouth and the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The conflict between the Newtonians and the Leibnizians is often
portrayed as a dispute over priority for the invention of the calculus.
It was that, but it was much more, since the participants differed on
matters of substance concerning theology, natural philosophy, and
mathematics. The first and second editions of Newton’s Principia were
published during this protracted conflict. By examining a few
propositions about orbits and some continental reactions to them we can
infer some of the differences between the two schools concerning
mathematical methods and values.

A first course in point-set topology tends to not only be divorced from
history, but also divorced from any other branch of mathematics in the
minds of many students. This makes continued motivation of new
topological concepts difficult. In contrast, the historical development
of certain concepts provides automatic motivation and places the concept
in its larger mathematical context. In this talk, we will outline a
preliminary list of topics which trace the evolution of connectedness.
Beginning with Cantor and a problem of Fourier series, we investigate
the contributions of Jordan and Schoenflies, culminating in the current
definition first given by Lennes. We share pedagogical suggestions to
connect the thought of these mathematicians to build a coherent
narrative which teaches some of the main properties of connectedness
through part of its historical development.

              reflect on how we might better understand the history of

              groups include slide rules, planimeters, sectors,
              protractors, dividers and drawing compasses, scale
              rules, parallel rules, and sets of drawing
              instruments—in all, over 650 objects and related
              documentation from the NMAH mathematics
              collections. [This is a completely different talk from

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
From the late nineteenth century, Americans have made and sold special
forms of drawing instruments for recreational use. Drawing instruments –
unlike playing cards, tangrams, the fifteen puzzle and dissections –
were initially made as useful tools for architects, navigators,
engineers and craftsmen. A few manufacturers offered special designs for
entertainment. Mathematicians and mathematics educators occasionally
took an interest in these toys, both as inspiration for research and as
classroom novelties. Instruments for drawing geometric figures, sold as
the polygraph, the Wondergraph, the Hoot Nanny, and, most successfully,
the Spirograph, merit particular attention. Versions of the pantograph,
a machine for enlarging and reducing figures, also deserve brief mention.

Correcting an Error in Book I of Archimedes' <q>On Floating Bodies</q> </pubtitle>
            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Archimedes is credited with quantifying the concept of the center of
gravity of an object and in his works he determined the locations of the
centers of gravity of many planar and solid bodies. His calculations,
however, implicitly assumed that the body was immersed in a uniform
gravitational field, so he was actually determining the location of the
body's center of mass (or centroid). He did not realize that the concept
of a center of gravity is not applicable in a nonuniform gravitational
field, a fact that many are not aware of even today. This led to his
incorrectly proving an erroneous theorem at the end of Book 1 of his
work <q>On Floating Bodies.</q> His theorem states that a truncated sphere
floating in a body of water on a spherical earth that attracts objects
to its center will float stably with its base horizontally under very
general conditions. I'll discuss his error and suggest an alternate
proof of a similar correct result.

              area of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides,
              is one of the great, peculiar results of plane geometry.
              It is thus to be expected that, over the years, there
              have been multiple demonstrations of this remarkable
              formula. Here, I consider four such proofs. Heron's
              original was a clever if convoluted exercise in
              Euclidean geometry. Centuries later, Isaac Newton gave a
              demonstration whose heavy lifting was done by algebra
              rather than geometry. Leonhard Euler’s proof was
              geometric and exhibited his characteristic flair. Then
              in 1990 Barney Oliver, a former recipient of the
              National Medal of Science, shared with me an elegant
              trigonometric argument where the symmetry of the formula
              was mirrored by the symmetry of the proof itself. The
              first two of these – Heron’s and Newton’s – I’ll mention
              only briefly. The second pair – Euler’s and Barney’s –
              I'll prove in detail. Taken together, these should
              remind us why the history of our discipline is such a
              fine source for wonderful mathematics.

Modern logicians ordinarily do not distinguish between the terms

meanings were quite different.and their tie to implication unclear. In
this paper, I will explore the views of four prominent British logicians
of the period, W. E. Johnson, J.N. Keynes, H. MacColl, and J. Venn on
these issues.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Guillaume François Antoine de l’Hôpital’s /Analyse des infiniment
petits/ (1696) was the first ever calculus textbook. It was also
something of an enigma. For one thing, it was published anonymously,
although de L’Hôpital’s authorship was no secret. Also, it made no
mention of the integral calculus: instead, its introduction to the
differential calculus was followed by what can only be described as an
advanced text on differential geometry, motivated by what were then
cutting-edge problems in mechanics and optics. However, the oddest
aspect of this book is its genesis. The introductory chapters were based
on Johann Bernoulli’s /Lectiones de calculo differentialium/, lessons
that only ever existed in manuscript form and were unknown to the
scholarly community until 1921. De l’Hôpital received his copy when he
hired Bernoulli to tutor him in 1691-92. Subsequently, he “purchased”
the advanced material of the later chapters, in an arrangement under
which he supported Bernoulli with a stipend in 1694-95. In this talk, we
will consider both the mathematics that was presented in the Analyse and
the process by which in came into being. We will compare de l’Hôpital’s
exposition of the elements of the differential calculus with that of
Bernoulli and examine some of the more advanced results presented in the
Analyse.

The Moscow Mathematical Society, which grew out of a math circle, had
its first meeting on September 27, 1864. It was founded with the purpose
of promoting mathematical sciences in Russia. In few years, it started
the publication of the “Mathematichekij Sbornik,” the first Russian
Mathematics Journal. The Moscow Society reflected the philosophy of the
Moscow School of Mathematics which rejected the importance of applied
mathematics and emphasized mysticism and spirituality, whereas the St.
Petersburg School of Mathematics, influenced by the French school, saw
the importance of practical applications in development of mathematical
ideas.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
American postulate theory is the body of work of several American
mathematicians in the first few decades of the twentieth century,
concerned with studying the structure of established mathematical
theories by examining fundamental assumptions. They examined alternative
postulational formulations and considered desirable features of a
postulate system: consistency, independence, completeness, categoricity,
brevity. John Corcoran, “On Definitional Equivalence and Related
Topics,” History of Symbolic Logic 1 (1980), 231—234, introduced the
term “American postulate theory,” identified some of its practitioners
and suggested a need for historical study of their work. Michael Scanlan
“Who Were the American Postulate Theorists?,” The Journal of Symbolic
Logic 56 (1991), 981—1002 and “American Postulate Theorists and Alfred
Tarski,”History and Philosophy of Logic 24 (2003), 307-325 identified
others, compared two American postulate theorists to European
contemporaries, and analyzed their influence on mathematical logicians.
I will undertake a broader review, attempting at least partial answers
to the following questions: Who contributed to American Postulate
Theory? What were the characteristics of their research? Who or what
influenced them? Were there mutual influences or rivalries among them?
What influence did they have on other lines of mathematical research?
Did a theory of postulation develop?

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In this study of the cultural history of mathematics, I consider the
architecture of mathematical institutes as historical artifacts. The
buildings in which mathematical research and teaching take place offer
incredible insight into the work practices, as well as social and
cultural identities, of the mathematicians who inhabit these spaces. As
a case study, I consider the career of the mathematician Richard Courant
(1888-1972), who served as director during the construction of two
world-class mathematical institutes – the first, in the late 1920s at
the University of Göttingen (where he was exiled in 1933), and then in
the 1960s at New York University. In both cases, I consider the
buildings’ planning, development, construction, and habitation
processes, examining blueprints, committee meeting minutes, and
correspondence between the mathematicians, university administrators,
government officials and philanthropy representatives. Ultimately, I
hope to explore how the built environment mattered to those whose work
required a certain type of private workspace, desk, and chalkboard
–situated in the right relationship to shared workspaces, a mathematics
library, classrooms, and other scientific departments. What can the
physical environment of mathematical institutes tell the historian about
the work practices and social identities of mathematicians?

              the oldest machines still in use today.  It is now
              enjoying renewed popularity because of its proven
              trouble-free design, its ability to lift wastewater and
              debris-laden water effectively, and its gentle treatment
              of aquatic life. Within the last decade it has also
              found a new application in the generation of electricity
              by being run backwards. In this presentation I will give
              a history of this device from Archimedes' time (3rd
              century BC) to the present day and also discuss my past
              and proposed research on the design of the Screw that
              maximizes the amount of water lifted or lowered in each
              turn of the screw.

Duncan F. Gregory (1813-1844) was a proponent of the Calculus of
Operations and a founding editor of the /Cambridge Mathematical
Journal/. Extant is a series of six letters that Gregory wrote to a

early-Victorian Cambridge, reveals something of the character of Gregory
and his dedication to the /CMJ/, and shows some of the mathematical
problems he pondered.In this talk, we will look briefly at Cambridge,
Gregory and the /CMJ/, and will examine several of the problems.

important roles in the development of mathematics in the U.S. during the
first half of the twentieth century. In this talk we describe the life
and careers of those mathematicians who obtained doctorates under
Hilbert 1899-1910, emphasizing the critical role they played in what was
then the southwestern part of the country, particularly at the
University of Missouri. We end by comparing the schools of American
students produced by Felix Klein, Sophus Lie, and David Hilbert

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Since ancient times conquerors
              have sent mathematicians out to survey what has been
              taken. Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820), surveyor and
              mathematician, had a profound impact on the shape of
              this country (and opined about what had been taken),
              establishing boundaries of states and cities as well as
              its international boundaries both north and south. In
              1785 he set the boundary of western Pennsylvania and in
              1791 surveyed the territory now known as the District of
              Columbia which was my first motivation in studying
              Ellicott. In 1796, he surveyed the international border
              between the U.S. and Spanish territories in Florida
              under the San Lorenzo Treaty. In 1817, he was appointed
              astronomer for the United States establishing the
              boundary between the US and Canada concluding the War of
              1812. As a teacher his most famous student was
              Meriwether Lewis (a second motivation) who needed field
              instruction before Lewis and Clark's great expedition to
              the west. In 1813, he was appointed by President Monroe
              as a professor of mathematics at the Military Academy at
              West Point where he was among the first in the country
              who taught a class in calculus (a third motivation). I
              will speak somewhat briefly about each of these events.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Nomography can be defined as the study and preparation of graphical
representations of mathematical equations. These representations usually
take the form of charts or diagrams from which the values of certain
variables in the relation can be read once others have been given. The
subject has a history which goes back several centuries and is closely
tied with engineering applications. It was organized as a body of
knowledge by Maurice d’Ocagne, a French engineer, at the turn of the
twentieth century. Nomography then spread to other countries, including
America, in later years, where it became of use to engineers and
scientists, and of interest to mathematicians. From an American
Nomography text of 1947 used at MIT comes the following quote: “The
theory of the nomgraphic chart cannot be dismissed as a simple topic.
Mathematicians who do so are unaware that a complete treatment of the
subject draws on every aspect of analytic, descriptive, and projective
geometries, the several fields of algebra, and other mathematical
fields. This suggests a conflict over the status of nomography as a
mathematical area: how deep is the mathematics of this subject? Is it
more than just a set of techniques for drawing charts? Can nomography
give rise to problems of genuine mathematical interest? We will examine
these questions as they presented themselves to American mathematicians
of the era 1900-1950 and give examples of the connections between
nomography and: elementary properties of determinants, the duality
principle of projective geometry, classification problems in elementary
algebraic forms, finding roots of real polynomials, simple partial
differential equations, cubic curves, and Hilbert’s thirteenth problem
(number of examples to be limited by time constraints). An attempt will
be made to determine how American mathematicians of this era felt about
the mathematical status of nomography.

In 1734 Bishop George Berkeley published <pubtitle>The Analyst; or A Discourse
Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician</pubtitle>, wherein he, quite famously and
in some cases correctly, criticized Newton's Doctrine of Fluxions.
Maclaurin's 1742 book <pubtitle>The Elements of the Method at Fluxions</pubtitle> is
usually taken to be the definitive Newtonian response to Berkeley. But
there were earlier attempts to clarify and/or rigorize Newton. One was
Benjamin Robins' <pubtitle>Treatise on Fluxions</pubtitle> published only one year after
Berkeley. In his introduction Robins explains his purpose, <q>For though
Sir Isaac Newton has very distinctly explained . . . these subjects . . . yet
as the great author's great brevity has made a more diffusive
illustration not altogeher unnecessary; (1) have here endeavored to
consider more at large each of these methods; whereby, I hope, it will
appear that they have all the accuracy of the strictest mathematical
demonstration.</q> That is, Robins presents his text as simply <q>filling in
the blanks</q> left by Newton. I will examine some key theorems/proofs from
Robins' text.

Almost immediately after Einstein published his first paper on

geometrical language. Minkowski's was, of course, the broadest and most
successful effort, but beginning in 1909, Sommerfeld and Varicak
developed a geometric representation of relativistic velocities. In this
talk I shall discuss these developments and explain the setting in which
Felix Klein unified them.

Analytic geometry and mathematical physics may have interested a

to focus their mathematical attention.In the century’s first half,
algebraic work centered on the development of the so-called “symbolical
algebra” and the creation of new algebras, while in its second, the
theory of invariants dominated and the theory of groups witnessed key
developments.Underlying much of this research was the philosophical
question of how free mathematicians were to create new mathematical
entities.The Victorian British response to that question was ultimately,

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Nomography can be roughly
              defined as the theory and methods by which numerical
              evaluation of ordinary functional relations can be
              accomplished geometrically. (The slide rule is a simple
              example of one such method.)It was established as a
              mathematical discipline in 1899 by Maurice d'Ocagne
              (1862-1938), an accomplished French engineer who
              synthesized earlier work on this subject. His 1899
              volume <pubtitle>Traite de Nomographie</pubtitle> is a
              systematic development of the construction and use of
              what came to be called nomograms (variously called
              charts, alignment diagrams, intersection diagrams, or
              abaques) for use in computations in diverse engineering
              disciplines. While the use of nomograms to aid in
              calculation became widespread in Europe in the following
              years, the mathematics associated with their
              construction received attention as well. This resulted
              in articles in mathematical journals and a mention of
              the field by Hilbert in connection with problem 13 of
              his list of 23 problems of 1900. Nomograms have been
              described by one writer as the <q>fractals of their
              day</q> due to their relation to mathematical law and
              visual appeal.

<p>
             This talk attempts to survey how nomography was
             introduced into the United States in the years following
             the publication of d'Ocagne's book, looking at its debut
             in the various communities of mechanical, civil, and
             electrical engineers, scientists, and mathematicians,
             with special focus on the latter. During the period from
             1900 to 1950 mathematicians such as Frank
             Morley,E. H. Moore, T. H. Gronwall, O. D. Kellogg, Lester
             Ford and Edward Kasner concerned themselves with
             popularizing, extending, and using the ideas of
             nomography. The subject was taught in colleges and
             technical institutes, often out of textbooks written by
             the instructors. It appealed to all types of mathematical
             people:pure researchers, college professors and high
             school teachers, and had its enthusiasts among
             algebraists, geometers and analysts. Nomograms became
             particularly popular as a graphical method for solving
             polynomial equations of degree five or less, and found a
             place in the changing nature of college algebra during
             this time. We also will mention some mathematical
             obstacles which occurred as they came into wider use in
             scientific, engineering and industrial settings.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> As is well known, there was
              little concern in Apollonius' Conics about the actual
              <q>mechanical</q> construction of the conic sections. In
              fact, it is not entirely clear whether there ever was an
              interest in Classical Antiquity in any tool that would
              draw a given conic section in the same way one can draw
              a circle with the help of a compass. There certainly was
              an interest in such a tool among Muslim
              mathematicians. In Renaissance Europe, a number of
              mathematicians suggested various mechanical ways to
              construct the conic sections as well-although no actual
              drawing devices seem to have been built.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
As is well-known, Legendre was the first to state the Law of Quadratic
Reciprocity in the form that we now know it (though an equivalent result
had earlier been conjectured by Euler), and he was able to prove it in
some but not all cases, with the first complete proof being given by
Gauss. In this talk we trace the evolution of Legendre's work on
quadratic reciprocity in his four great works on number theory, from
1785, 1797, 1808, and 1830.

In 1734 Bishop Berkeley criticized the logical foundations of the
Calculus in <pubtitle>The Analyst</pubtitle> and set off a small 'pamphlet war'. James
Jurin and John Walton replied immediately and angrily. Berkeley then
responded to each of them. Shortly after this exchange Jurin and
Benjamin Robins engaged in a lengthy and eventually acrimonious public
debate on the same topic. Somewhat later Benjamin Robins, Collin
Maclaurin, Thomas Simpson and others wrote treatises on <q>The Method of
Fluxions</q>	which were at least in part intended as responses to <q>The
Analyst</q>. view of Calculus in its earliest stages. I will attempt to
peer through that window.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
During the early decades of the twentieth century the notion of a
compact topological space arose as a generalization of results obtained
in studies of the topology of the real line (in particular, the
Heine-Borel theorem). Somewhat later, what is now called the Compactness
Theorem for first-order logic was proved by Godel as a lemma in his
proof that every first-order axiom system is semantically complete. But
for years thereafter connections between the two notions of compactness
lay unrecognized and applications of compactness in logical contexts
were not pursued. This talk will survey how the Compactness Theorem
eventually came to be regarded as a fundamental tool in model theory and
algebra, and will explore why recognition of it's usefulness was so long
delayed.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> The history of mathematics in
              traditional China is often clouded by myth and
              uncertainty. For the Chinese Empire, mathematics was not
              a priority.  Mathematicians were not highly honored nor
              recognized for their work.  They worked in
              isolation. Social and political upheavals within the
              Kingdom were frequent, resulting in the destruction of
              books and libraries. In such a climate of turmoil,
              efforts at preservation focused on Confucian and
              philosophical classics. Scientific works, including
              those about mathematics were frequently destroyed and
              lost. Later mathematicians were forced to rediscover
              techniques and concepts established by their
              predecessors. Thus, in examining the state and content
              of traditional mathematics in China, one must rely on
              <q>glimpses.</q> This talk will survey some of the
              accomplishments of traditional Chinese mathematics and
              discuss the interaction of societal pressures on the
              development of mathematical thinking.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Nearly every undergraduate student of mathematics learns how to solve
linear systems with the help of determinants, so it may come as a
surprise that the history of the development of the determinant is not
better known than it is. In fact, there may be a good reason for this:
befitting the complexity of the idea, its history is also quite
complicated. The story of its genesis and evolution involves the
interplay of a number of different problems, perspectives and
approaches, and contributions were made by dozens of people over
centuries. We plan to survey a key period of this history, for the time
of Leibniz at the end of the 17th century, up to the watershed day of
November 30, 1812, when Binet and Cauchy both presented papers on the
determinant at the same meeting in Paris.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Over 30 colleges and universities offered cryptology courses during
World War II. There was great diversity in who delivered the classes.
Mathematicians were represented, as were the departments of astronomy,
biology, classics, English, geology, Greek, philosophy, and psychology.
Even a dean managed to make himself useful...Some classes were secret,
run for the benefit of the military, while others were open to all. The
lecture surveys these courses, along with biosketches of the professors
and, in some cases, describes original research contributions they made
to the field of cryptology.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> In the mid-seventeenth
              century, it was generally thought that the shape of a
              hanging chain was a parabola. In a series of letters
              with Marin Mersenne, the 17-year-old Christiaan Huygens
              showed that the hanging chain did not in fact take the
              form of a parabola. We will investigate some of
              Huygens's geometrical arguments in detail, and we will
              discuss some of the general history of the problem.

              towards algebra. Nevertheless, some followed other lines
              of research.  Mathematicians had originally introduced a
              resolvent equation as a step towards solving a given
              equation by radicals. After Galois' theory became known,
              mathematicians still studied resolvent equations, but
              now with new aims. This talk is the outgrowth of my
              attempt understand the background to one of the late
              manuscripts of Arthur Cayley that were previously
              discussed by Dr. Weintraub.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was the most destructive political
movement in modern China. During that tumultuous ten-year period
millions died as a direct consequence of political struggles and tens of
millions were dislocated. Higher education was abandoned for the first
five years. Leading experts in virtually all academic areas were
deprived their rights of conducting research of their own interest. The
promise of mathematical research during the first fifteen years of the
newly created Communist China came to a halt, and then faded away. After
briefly describing the status of mathematical research in Communist
China before 1966, the speaker will provide a setting for the Cultural
Revolution by showing a 10-minute documentary film. He will then take
two leading Chinese mathematicians, Wu Wenjun, better known in the West
as Wen- tsun Wu, and Gong Sheng, as examples, to discuss how the
Cultural Revolution affected mathematicians’ personal lives and
research. In order to show how politics and Marxist ideology determined
mathematical research in mainland China during this period, the talk
will also discuss Chinese translations of Karl Marx’s Mathematical
Manuscripts and the nation-wide discussion of the Manuscripts.

The Journal of Symbolic Logic 56:3 (Sep 1991), 981--1002) and as the
mathematician behind the method of apportioning Representatives among
the states (Thomas L. Bartlow, Mathematics and Politics: Edward V.
Huntington and the Apportionment of the United States Congress,
Proceedings of the Canadian Society for History and Philosophy of
Mathematics 19 (2006), 29--54). However, much of his teaching was in the
Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard and, in 1907, he became chairman
of the Committee on the Teaching of Mathematics to Students of
Engineering, a joint committee of the AMS and the AAAS. This led him to
become involved in the Society for the Promotion of Engineering
Education and to write several papers on mathematics and mechanics in
the training of engineers.

To Tom on his Retirement [from Villanova University]
by Doug Norton, May 13, 2008

The hist’ry of things mathematical
At times can make folks quite fanatical;
But someone we know,
Our own Tom Bartlow,
Instead made a move not so radical:

Along with his bud Zitarelli,
He runs a series that’s quite swell. He,
With grace and aplomb,
 Hosts talks at PASHoM
  [The Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics],
And also puts food in your belly
  [As usual, I will provide a light supper, at a cost of $6, or $7, or
$8 …].

So now that his teaching he’s leaving,
You Math Hist’ry folks: please, no grieving!
With all that free time,
He’s still in his prime:
Math Hist’ry we’ll all keep receiving.

So as you go off in the sunset,
We all know you are not quite done yet:
You’ll make with Michele
More stories to tell;
We know you’re not through having fun yet!

As Max Born fled Germany in 1933, he started a research project in which

electrodynamics in order to produce a quantum electrodynamics. In this
talk, I will describe the circumstances that led Born to leap backwards
in order to try and leap forwards, what he and his collaborators
achieved, and what this episode tells us about the history of the
development of quantum mechanics.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Book historians have added a number of dimensions to our understanding
of texts in the history of science and mathematics, including how
readers and publishers participate alongside authors in the transmission
of knowledge, how patterns of use indicate intellectual reception, and
how textbooks communicate scientific ideas to popular audiences.
However, promotion has been at least as important a factor as
pedagogical and intellectual superiority in determining which objects
have become widely established instruments for teaching mathematics and
science. This talk explores the evolution of the textbook into a
commercialized teaching tool by concentrating on how the partnership of
Charles Davies (1798-1876) and Alfred Smith Barnes (1817-1888) shaped
mathematics instruction in the United States. Davies parlayed his
reputation as a professor at the United States Military Academy at West
Point into a successful career of defining himself primarily as a
producer of textbooks. Barnes, his publisher, organized the books into
graded series and utilized aggressive marketing techniques. Together,
the men sought to enlarge their audience of American students and laid
claim to national status as the standard for the nascent mathematics
textbook industry. This talk is based upon the first chapter of/Material
to Learn: Tools of American Mathematics Teaching, 1800-2000/, a
forthcoming book prepared jointly with Peggy Aldrich Kidwell and David
Lindsay Roberts, and will include a few highlights from the entire volume.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Quantitative literacy is a
              necessity for good citizenship, so it is appropriate
              that the <q>first American</q> was numerate in the
              extreme.  That's not to say that Ben Franklin ever
              proved a novel theorem, but he was willing to apply
              basic mathematics to situations where only qualitative
              arguments had been admitted previously. This talk will
              explore the various mathematical aspects of Franklin’s
              life.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> At the close of World War I
              those who studied ballistics began to turn their
              attention to the <q>second order effects</q> <mdash/>
              how such factors as wind, density of air, and small
              changes in initial velocity affected the range of a
              projectile.Related to these questionsis the matter of
              the dispersion of a series of shots fired under as
              nearly identical conditions as possible, and how one
              measures this dispersion. In the United States efforts
              were made to introduce standard tools of elementary
              probability: mean, standard deviation (actually
              <q>probable error</q>) , and normal distribution of
              errors, into this milieu, with mixed results.The talk
              highlights the attempt of Philip Schwartz, a young
              artillery officer with some mathematical background and
              an associate of Oswald Veblen, to analyze these concepts
              as they were used in dealing with the data of artillery
              firing.Emphasis is given on how difficult men found it
              to understand, defend, and apply these concepts by
              viewing a controversy played out in the pages of the
              Coast Artillery Journal during the years 1924-1930. No
              knowledge other than that of elementary probability and
              the normal distribution is required.

We will examine Luca Pacioli’s contributions to mathematics. The Italian
mathematician Luca Pacioli discussed mathematics with Leonardo Da Vinci,
wrote books on arithmetic, and worked on chess problems. His long-lost
manuscript on chess was recently discovered in Italy. Pacioli’s system
of double-entry bookkeeping has a group structure and can be viewed as
error-detecting code. We will also discuss some of the controversy
surrounding his work and publications.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Under Alexander Dallas Bache the United States Coast Survey grew into an
important, perhaps the most important, institution for American science.
With little graduate work available in the United States, it served as
an essential training ground as well as a source of employment for
American scientists. When Peirce took over the Coast Survey after
Bache’s death, he had no administrative experience. Yet he was able to
garner even better congressional support for the Survey than had the
politically savvy Bache. Peirce continued to support a broad spectrum of
scientific activity. He was also successful in expanding the Survey my
making a geodetic link between the existing surveys on the east and west
coasts.This was not only a political triumph, but a scientific one.It
was the longest arc of a parallel ever surveyed by one country. The
extended scope of the Survey led to it being renamed the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey. During his tenure as superintendent of the
Coast Survey, Peirce maintained his professorship at Harvard and his
residence in Cambridge.He also wrote his Linear Associate Algebra, his
most important mathematical work, during this period.

              E edges, and F faces satisfies the relation <m>V-E+F=2</m>.
              This relationship was first noticed by Euler in 1750
              (although a related formula was known to Descartes in
              1630). Euler's proof turned out to be flawed. From 1750
              to 1850 mathematicians tried to come to grips with this
              formula. Legendre, Cauchy, Staudt, and others presented
              new proofs and generalizations. Meanwhile, Lhuilier,
              Hessel, and Poinsot unveiled exotic
              <q>counterexamples.</q> In this talk we present the
              history of this beloved formula up to the middle of the
              nineteenth century, while it was still a theorem about
              polyhedra and before it was recognized as a topological
              theorem.

In 2007 we celebrate the 300th anniversary of Euler’s birth. Many
aspects of Euler’s vast output will be examined during this year. In
this talk we will focus on Euler’s research in the field of Diophantine
problems. Such problems were a long-term interest of Euler and are still
of interest today.We will consider particular highlights from Euler’s
work on Diophantine equations, such as Euler’s landmark text
Vollständige Anleitung zur Algebra, his work on Fermat’s Last Theorem
and the Euler conjecture. This conjecture is related to Fermat’s Last
Theorem. Euler had proven the special case that the sum of two cubes is
never a cube. He then conjectured that the sum of three fourth-powers is
never a fourth-power, the sum of four fifth-powers never a fifth power
and so on. Many of the problems considered by Euler fall under the
heading of what are now called Euler sums. These are Diophantine
equations equating sums of like powers. For example, in a paper from
1754 we see Euler discussing the problem of when the sum of three cubics
will equal a cubic. We will examine the subsequent history of research
on Euler sums.

During the 1930’s and 40’s, several mathematicians—notably Stiefel,
Whitney, Pontrjagin, and Chern—developed the basic ideas of
characteristic classes. These cohomology classes of a bundle over a
manifold measure how far that bundle is from being a product. The
existence of non-zero classes proved the impossibility of certain
embeddings of manifolds. While these results were being found, other
results connected the characteristic classes to the curvature of the
base manifold.  Then, André Weil systematized that connection /via/
classical invariant theory. His unification led to new developments in
topology and geometry.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> De Morgan's Laws are familiar
              to any mathematician who has taken an undergraduate
              course in set theory.  Yet it is ironic that the man
              afterwhom they were named is remembered almost
              exclusively for a set of rules he did not invent in a
              subject he would never have known.  But the mathematical
              legacy of Augustus De Morgan spreads far wider than his
              limited fame of today would suggest.  In the last few
              decades historical research has shed light on forgotten
              aspects of De Morgan's work to give us a more complete
              picture of the range and diversity of his mathematical
              activities.  To mark the 200th anniversary of De
              Morgan's birth, this talk will examine the influence of
              these contributions and thus re-evaluate the impact of
              his work on the mathematical landscape of both his time
              and ours.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
In 1926 Bartel L. van der Waerden proved – and in 1927 published – a
magnificent theorem:  For any /k, l,/ there is/N/ =/N/(/k/,/l/)  such
that the set of whole rational numbers 1, 2, ..., /N/, partitioned into
/k /classes, contains an arithmetic progression of length /l /in one of
the classes. This result, which I call (in honor of the authors of the
conjecture and the author of the first proof) /Baudet-Schur-Van der
Waerden Theorem/, belongs to a few revolutionary, classic results which
form “/Ramsey Theory before Ramsey/”, and it has awakened my interest in
the life of Van der Waerden. I found the literature about his life
surprisingly contradictory. On the one hand, in the writings of Günther
Frei, Yvonne Dold-Samplonius, W. Peremans, and most recently Rüdiger
Thiele, I found the highest praise of Van der Waerden as a man of utmost
integrity, a hero of the opposition to the Third Reich. On the other
hand, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands refused to sign off on Van der
Waerden’s appointment to a chair at the University of Amsterdam in 1946,
and Miles Reid in his 1988 book wrote that “a number of mathematicians
of the immediate post-war period, including some of the leading
algebraic geometers, considered him a Nazi collaborator
            </p>
<p>
As a trained problem-solver, I commenced the search for the real Van der
Waerden. Now, 12+ years and many hundreds of documents later, I can
grant my predecessors one thing: it is hard to understand B. L. van der
Waerden. And while a complete insight is impossible, my research has
produced, I believe for the first time, a comprehensive portrait of Van
der Waerden the man. I would have liked to share with you much of my
findings, but it would take a few days, and thus overstep Tom Bartlow’s
hospitality. I will therefore try to do my best with the time I am
given. We will visit Van der Waerden during his early years, although my
main interest will be the two turbulent decades of his life: 1931-1951.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> The concept of the
              professional mathematician came relatively late to
              European history. (This truism is expressed in history
              of mathematics code as <q>Fermat was a lawyer.</q> After
              the ingenious dabblers had had their due, an array of
              institutions, titles, degrees, prizes and professorships
              secured mathematics as a professional endeavor. Among
              its other consequences, the rise of professional
              mathematics created a new set of formal barriers to
              women.I will summarize the experiences of three who
              succeeded in the new atmosphere: Sophie Germain, Sofia
              Kovalevskaia, and Alicia Boole Stott. These 19th-century
              mathematicians came from different countries, were of
              three distinct generations and hailed from contrasting
              economic backgrounds.I am uniting them here not merely
              to pay homage to exceptional talent, luck, and
              resources, but to highlight commonalities in their
              experiences as women.I wish to pose an important and
              difficult question: What do these women’s experiences
              tell us about the construction of mathematical
              knowledge?

              <alert>Title: </alert> <pubtitle>If Archimedes Had a Computer: Continuing his Work on Floating Bodies </pubtitle>
            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> According to legend,
              Archimedes ran naked through the streets of ancient
              Syracuse shouting <q>Eureka</q>! after discovering his
              famous Law of Buoyancy, the basic law that determines
              how things float. He illustrated this law in his work
              <pubtitle>On Floating Bodies</pubtitle> by computing various
              floating positions of a solid paraboloid. With the
              geometric tools of his day Archimedes could only
              consider those cases when the flat base of the
              paraboloid is not cut by the water. However, as I show
              using modern computing power, the most interesting
              things happen when the base is cut by the water. For
              example, an iceberg that is slowly melting can suddenly
              overturn, or an obelisk originally sitting on solid
              ground can come crashing down when the soil under it
              liquefies during an earthquake. Such drastic phenomena
              are now studied in Catastrophe Theory, a field that
              Archimedes could have begun if he had had the
              computational tools to investigate all the possible
              cases of his floating paraboloids.

Ballistics of the World War I Era in America </pubtitle>
            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> By 1917 the American
              mathematical community was quitediverse and stratified,
              comprising, among others, word class researchers,
              university and college instructors, some applied
              mathematicians, and students with Masters and Bachelors
              degrees who found various uses for their talents.  This
              work focus on four such <q>mathematical people,</q>
              Gilbert Ames Bliss, Forest Ray Moulton, Roger Sherman
              Hoar, and Philip Schwartz, to the <q>New Ballistics</q> of
              the World War I era. Their efforts included a revision
              of the approach to calculating trajectories by the
              introduction of numerical integration, a tying of the
              new methods to the newly emerging research area of
              functional analysis, an organization of this mass of
              material into a coherent, presentable form with some
              physical motivation of required formulae, and a critical
              and experimental look at the resulting work. These
              efforts were characterized by an unusual emphasis on
              mathematical rigor which is in some ways analogous to
              the movement in sophistication from calculus to advanced
              calculus, but also included instructional activities
              geared to making the new methods accessible to its
              users.

Philosophy and Politics  </pubtitle>
            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
 The main focus of the talk is von Mises’s “outsider-position” or
“non-conformism” in scientific, philosophical, and - to a lesser degree
- political respects and the implications for the reception of his
theory of probability, the one achievement he is still most known for
today. Not unexpectedly, a considerable part of von Mises’
“non-conformism” was related to his “betweenness” with respect to
mathematics and its applications, which can be related to his education
as an engineer and mathematician and to his practical work.
Von Mises gave in 1919 a definition for the then rather new discipline
“theory of probability” and tried to relate and connect it to existing
“pure mathematics” on the one hand and to applications in statistics and
physics on the other. This attempt was, indeed, very influential, if
perhaps even more in a “critical” than in a constructive meaning,
“critical” including both von Mises’s criticism of existing notions and
applications of probability and ensuing criticism of von Mises’s
proposals by others such as A.N.Kolmogorov and A.Ya.Khinchin.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) published more than 800 books and articles,
many of which are among the most important mathematics ever discovered.
Over 80 of his papers are about series, and two of his books deal
primarily with series.Some of his results appear in <q>blockbuster</q> papers
that make a huge contribution in just a single paper. Examples include
the Basel Problem paper in which he evaluates 
<m>\zeta(2)</m>, Philip Naudé's
problem in which he solves many problems of partition numbers, his paper
on the Sum-Product formula for the zeta function and his paper on the
foundations of continued fractions.There are other ideas, though, where
the results are spread out over several papers, like the
Euler-Mascheroni constant and Euler-Maclaurin series, were developed
over several papers and several years.We will follow some of these
lesser threads and trace a few of these longer stories, and connect them
to the mathematical and scientific life in the 18th century.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>
What is sometimes casually described as the <q>mathematics community</q> in
the United States already by the late 19th century was displaying
divisions, which became more distinct and variegated through the course
of the 20th century. The aim of this talk is to use the arena of
mathematics education during the 1950s and 1960s, which encompassed most
of the so-called <q>new math</q> educational reforms, to illuminate fine
distinctions between and within professional groups involved with
mathematics, notably the American Mathematics Society, the Mathematical
Association of America, and the National Council of Teachers of
Mathematics. Simple dichotomies such as researchers versus teachers,
pure mathematicians versus applied mathematicians, mathematicians versus
mathematics educators, or progressive versus traditional educators offer
only limited utility in understanding the complex jurisdictional
struggle that in fact occurred.By close analysis of the career
trajectories of several representative figures from the period, a more
nuanced categorization will be proposed, yielding a better understanding
of the outcome of the reforms.Special attention will be given to
individuals associated with two of the most prominent curriculum reform
projects: the University of Illinois Committee on School Mathematics
(UICSM), and the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG), originally
headquartered at Yale and later at Stanford.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> In the early 1950s, the
              academic discipline that we know today as computer
              science existed only as a loose association of
              institutions, individuals, and techniques. Although
              computers were widely used in this period as instruments
              of scientific production, their status as legitimate
              objects of scientific scrutiny had not yet been
              established.Computer programming in particular was
              considered by many to be a <q>black art,</q> a private
              arcane matter. General programming principles were
              largely nonexistent and the success of a program
              depended primarily on the programmer's private
              techniques and inventions. Those scientists and
              mathematicians who left <q>respectable</q> disciplines
              for the uncharted waters of computer science faced
              ridicule, self-doubt, and professional uncertainty. As
              the commercial computer industry expanded at the end of
              the decade, however, corporate interest in the science
              of computing increased significantly.Faced with a
              serious shortage of experienced, capable software
              developers, corporate employers turned to the
              universities as a source of qualified
              programmers.Academic researchers, unsure of what skills
              and knowledge were associated with computing expertise,
              began to develop a detailed psychological profile of the
              <q>ideal</q> computer scientist.Their profile included
              not only an aptitude for chess, music, and mathematics,
              but also specific personality characteristics
              (<q>uninterested in people,</q> <q>highly detail
              oriented,</q> etc.). Many of these early empirical
              studies turned out to be of questionable validity and
              were of almost no use to potential employers;
              nevertheless, many of the characteristics identified in
              these early personality profiles survived in the
              cultural lore of the industry and are still believed to
              be indicators of computer science ability.  My paper
              explores the development of computer science as an
              academic discipline from the perspective of the
              corporate employers who encouraged it as a means of
              producing capable programming personnel. I explore the
              uneasy symbiotic relationship that existed between
              academic researchers and their more industrial-oriented
              colleagues. I focus on the use of psychological profiles
              and aptitudes as a means of identifying
              <q>scientific</q> and mathematical abilities and
              expertise.

In 1929, a new Mathematical Institute opened just outside the old city
walls of Goettingen, with Richard Courant assuming its prestigious
directorship. This modern facility offered the venerable department a
spacious library, comfortable offices, housing facilities for visitors,
and prominent exhibit space for its valuable collection of mathematical
models and instruments. Only four years later, however, the ascendancy
of the Nazi party forced the faculty to emigrate to the United States.
Their hastily chosen replacements needed to steer an impossible course
between the department's hallowed tradition and the odious dictates of
the regime.

              final chapter called <q>Integraph. Table of
              Integrals.</q> In this chapter, Granville describes the
              theory and operation of a machine that draws integral
              curves by tracing a given curve. Later editions describe
              not only the Integraph, but also polar planimeters. By
              the 1941 edition, this material had disappeared. I will
              examine the operation of the relatively simple Integraph
              and speculate on the reasons for its inclusion in the
              text.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> In a parallel universe, the
              Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics
              celebrated its semiquincentennial in 2001. There, our
              alternate selves reflected on the founding members,
              local scholars who managed to do a little mathematics in
              the isolated colonial backwater called
              Philadelphia. Most prominent of these early
              mathematicians was Benjamin Franklin, master of the
              magic square.  Until recently it appeared that only two
              of Franklin's magic squares were still extant. In fact
              these were really two instances of the same example,
              extended to different orders. Now, however, it is clear
              that more than a half-dozen squares survive. How do
              these compare with their predecessors? How exactly did
              Franklin effect his numerical oddities? What is the
              state of the art today? We consider these questions as
              well as some other mathematics of the day.

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Before we had electronic
              devices to do scientific computation, lengthy
              calculations were done by large groups of human
              computers. These individuals were usually intelligent
              persons who were unable to pursue a career in science
              because of their social or economic standing. They are
              best characterized as <q>blue collar mathematicians.</q>
              Several of the human computers, notably the staff at the
              U. S. Nautical Almanac, the workers at George Snedecor's
              Statistical Laboratory and the members of the WPA
              Mathematical Tables Project, made many small
              contributions to the development of numerical
              analysis. The Mathematical Tables Project, which was
              probably the largest computing group of modern time with
              over 450 computers at its prime, became the basis for
              the Institute for Numerical Analysis at UCLA and the
              Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the National Bureau of
              Standards. This talk is based on a new book, which is
              being published by Princeton University Press

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> In 1899, Ivar Fredholm
              (1866-1927) devised a method for solving a type of
              functional equation where the unknown function appears
              under the integral sign, a problem going back to Abel
              and which had already received some study at the hands
              of Vito Volterra and Picard's student J. Le Roux. This
              rather special-sounding problem had profound
              resonances. For one thing, it could be combined with
              methods of Carl Neumann and Henri Poincaré to prove the
              existence of solutions to many boundary-value problems,
              and indeed to find these solutions using Picard's
              successive approximation method. Still more far-reaching
              were the insights it provided to David Hilbert and his
              student Erhard Schmidt, who reinterpreted Fredholm's
              methods into the point of departure for what we now term
              operator theory on Hilbert spaces. In this paper, I
              examine the first of these threads, mostly concentrating
              on French and Italian work of the period from 1902 to

              <alert>Abstract: </alert> An introduction to the
              literature on the psychology of mathematicians, and
              other scientists. For example, highly intelligent people
              with mild forms of autism often love mathematics and
              tend to excel at it. This leads into a discussion of the
              nature of mathematical creativity and what has been
              learned about it since Poincare gave his famous lecture
              on the subject just a century ago.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Relatively few mathematical
              instruments have been designed, made and sold by a
              single mathematician. However, in the early decades of
              the twentieth century, the English-born mathematician
              Richard P. Baker not only taught mathematics in the
              Midwestern United States, but designed and made several
              hundred types of mathematical models. He sold copies of
              many of these to colleges and high schools throughout
              the country. Baker’s models reflect traditions in
              American teaching, the concerns of contemporary
              mathematicians and scientists, and his own wide-ranging
              interests.

            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> The United States Military
              Academy celebrated its centennial in 1902 but was it a
              vibrant intellectual center or a school with a hundred
              years of tradition unimpeded by progress? Since the
              study of mathematics occupied a substantial portion of
              the education of every graduate, this motivates us to
              look at all aspects of the department of mathematics:
              Who were the faculty? What was their education and
              experience? What was the curriculum? Which textbooks
              were used? How were the classes conducted? How did the
              department interact with the national mathematical
              community? How did world events impact the department?

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert>To a large extent Hilbert's
              list of problems (Paris, 1900) steered the course of
              mathematics in the 20th century. However, posing
              problems is an old mathematical tradition and there are
              many famous problems from the 17th century, among them
              the most influential Brachistochrone Problem (Johann
              Bernoulli, 1696). As a consequence of this problem
              mathematical physics (in its true meaning) got its start
              by developing essential variational methods that
              resulted in a new branch of mathematics. Moreover, the
              concept of an analytic function was formulated
              (Bernoulli, 1697) and extended (Euler, since 1727). This
              lecture gives a comprehensive overview on these
              cornerstones of mathematics.

              entirely to mathematics in the United States was founded
              200 years ago, in 1804. This talk will present an
              overview of the contents of the Mathematical
              Correspondent and discuss its relative importance in the
              history of mathematics in the U.S. It will also provide
              biographical snippets of the founder, George Baron, and
              some of the major contributors.

            </p>
            <p>
              <alert>Abstract: </alert> Francis Nichols is a
              little-known figure whose most significant
              accomplishment may have been commissioning Thomas and
              George Palmer to print the first American edition of
              John Playfair's Elements of Geometry in 1806. Over the
              next fifteen years, Nichols sold numerous copies of this
              book to the students at Yale via Jeremiah Day, the
              professor of mathematics and natural philosophy
              there. Letters by Nichols in the Day Correspondence
              discuss the necessary transactions, Day's efforts to
              complete a series of mathematical textbooks, and the
              textbook series translated by Harvard professor John
              Farrar. The paper will explore Nichols's comments on
              these works as a case study of the reception of
              mathematics textbooks in early republican America.
