      <title>History of PASHoM</title>
      <p>
        Tom Bartlow described the genesis of PASHoM in  the summer of 2004 as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For many years friends interested in history of mathematics from
          colleges and universities in and around Philadelphia would greet one
          another at national meetings with the question, "Why do we have to
          travel hundreds of miles to talk about our common interest in history
          of mathematics? Why don't we get together at home?" In the fall of
          2000 David Zitarelli of Temple University and Paul Wolfson of West
          Chester University took the initiative, independently inviting people
          to colloquia at their institutions. At West Chester spoke on in
          November and in December at Temple Jim Stasheff talked about his
          experiences as a graduate student at Princeton in the 1950's.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two efforts prompted Tom Bartlow of Villanova University to
          invite all interested persons to an organizational meeting at
          Villanova University in January 2001. There it was agreed to establish
          the Philadelphia Area Seminar on the History of Mathematics to share
          our common interest in mathematics, to encourage one another in our
          research efforts, and to offer a forum for reporting on work in
          progress. Rudiger Thiele, who happed to be in town at the time,
          attended, offered us encouragement, and spoke informally about his
          investigation of Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem. He continues to
          claim status as the only foreign associate of PASHoM. Since then the
          seminar has met monthly, with interruptions in December and for
          summer. There are no officers or formal structure but David Zitarelli
          and Tom Bartlow have voluntarily assumed responsibility for necessary
          arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seminar will resume in the fall with a talk by Frederick
          W. Hartman of Villanova University on "Apolloniusâ€™ Ellipse and Evolute
          Revisited" on September 18, 2003 and a talk by Amy Ackerberg-Hastings
          on October 23, 2003.
        </p>
        <p>

          Meetings are at Villanova University, usually on the third Thursday of
          the month.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Tom Bartlow retired leadership in Summer 2012. Alan Gluchoff took over
        Fall 2012.
